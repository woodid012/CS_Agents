# CS Capital CRM

Internal CRM and analytics dashboard for CS Capital's renewable energy M&A advisory practice. Built with Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, and Neon PostgreSQL.

## Overview

The platform tracks bidder engagement, offtaker relationships, AI-generated insights, and Australian market intelligence for renewable energy transactions.

## Features

### CRM
- **Master Bidder List** — full bidder engagement tracking with tier, geography, type, commentary, and contact details
- **Offtaker Engagement List** — counterparty tracking with offtaker-specific insights

### Analytics (`/analytics`)
- Bidder tier distribution, type breakdown, and geography charts
- Flagged tables: Tier 1 bidders, Suggest Upgrade candidates (Tier 2+ with A/B AI score), FIRB risk bidders
- Australia market context panel (CIS tenders, FIRB landscape, ACCC merger regime)
- Major transactions panel (recent M&A deals with live data)
- Recent news and intelligence feed
- Investor AUM and Australia capex reference table
- Key transmission infrastructure tracker

### Market Data
- **Price Curves** (`/market-data/price-curves`) — forward price curve data
- **Capex / Opex** (`/market-data/capex-opex`) — capex and opex benchmarks

### Comps Research (`/comps`)
Curated stats & comparables tracked across deals — for internal benchmarking.

- **Wide, open-ended scope**: valuations ($ total and per-unit), capex, capex
  splits (AC/DC/EPC/BoS), connection & system-strength charges, opex, land &
  rent, community contributions, **financing/debt**, offtake/PPA, returns and
  performance.
- **Every datapoint is referenced** — each row carries a source name and a
  clickable `source_url`.
- **Two views**: a per-metric table grouped by category (with automatic
  $/MW and $/MWh normalisation — works for capex *and* debt), and a per-deal
  summary view.
- **Filter** by technology, state, category and deal type; free-text search.
- **Add deals & metrics** inline; the metric picker is driven by the taxonomy
  and pre-fills the expected unit/basis.
- **Self-documenting** — a "schema reference" panel lists the full taxonomy.

Schema is intentionally **tall (entity–attribute–value)**: one `comp_deals`
row per deal/asset/transaction, one `comp_metrics` row per observed stat. This
means a new comp type is just a new entry in the taxonomy — **no DB migration**.

- Canonical taxonomy: `lib/compsTaxonomy.js` (categories, metrics, units, basis)
- Referenced dataset: `data/comps-scrape.json` — ~60 curated public AU comps
  from ~2020–2026 (M&A valuations; project capex/debt; transmission, pumped
  hydro, offshore wind & hydrogen projects; PPAs with term + start year;
  CIS tender awards tagged by round; GenCost benchmarks; NSW Benefit Sharing
  rates) plus flagged illustrative archetypes. Each row has a source URL.
- Deals carry a `program` field (e.g. "CIS Tender 3 — NEM Dispatchable") so
  awards can be filtered/tracked by scheme and tender round.
- Tables auto-create and seed on first visit to `/comps` from the same JSON
  (see `lib/compsDb.js`), matching the `/api/projects` pattern. DDL lives in
  `schema.sql`.
- To push the current dataset to the **online** DB (so the deployed `/comps`
  shows the latest), run `npm run scrape-comps` (idempotent: match-by-name,
  delete + re-insert). Needs `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local`.

The page renders everything in one place: the cost-comparison charts
($/MW, $/MWh), the metrics/deals tables, filters, the schema reference, and
add/edit forms.

**Data runner (two-tier)** — a cheap model scrapes candidate comps, a smart
model gatekeeps before they enter the dataset. `comps-scraper` (Haiku) stages
rows into `data/comps-candidates.json`; `comps-gatekeeper` (Opus) fact-checks,
approves/rejects and merges. Deterministic scripts (`validate-candidates.js`,
`merge-candidates.js`) enforce schema, sources and de-duplication. See
**COMPS_PIPELINE.md**.

> Note: M&A transaction values are public; per-project cost-stack detail
> (AC/DC/EPC splits, system strength, land, rent, MLF) is largely confidential,
> so those rows are CSIRO GenCost benchmarks, the NSW Benefit Sharing Guideline,
> or clearly flagged `Illustrative`. See the `_meta.disclaimer` in the JSON.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Access to Neon PostgreSQL database
- Excel source file: `Master Bidder Engagement List - CSC.xlsx` in project root

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...@...neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

### Install and Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

App runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Scripts

### Data Quality Audit

```bash
node scripts/audit-data.js           # Standard audit
node scripts/audit-data.js --verbose # Verbose output with per-bidder issues
node scripts/audit-data.js --json    # JSON output (CI-friendly)
```

Checks: required field coverage, tier/type/geography distribution, duplicate names, sequence gaps, AI insight coverage, contact coverage, market data file integrity.

### Database Migration

```bash
node scripts/migrate-to-neon.js
```

One-time migration of AI insights and contacts from JSON files to Neon PostgreSQL.

## Data Architecture

The bidder API (`/api/bidders`) merges three sources at runtime:

1. **Excel file** — master bidder data (no, name, geography, tier, type, commentary, engagement tracking)
2. **Neon DB `bidder_ai_data`** — AI insights, merged insights, AI scores and labels
3. **Neon DB `contacts`** — contact name, email, phone per bidder

Market data (`australia-market.json`, `capex-data.json`) is static JSON enriched periodically with live research.

## Market Data

`data/australia-market.json` contains:
- AU market overview (renewable share, capacity pipeline, AEMO forecasts)
- CIS tender progress (targets, awarded GW, risk factors)
- FIRB and ACCC regulatory landscape
- Major M&A transactions 2024-2026
- Key transmission projects
- Recent news and intelligence (enriched March 2026)

`data/capex-data.json` contains:
- AUM and Australia capex for 20+ investors (funds, utilities, super funds, pensions)
- Global summary and market outlook

## AI Tier Scoring

Each bidder receives an AI-generated score (1-5) and label (A/B/C/D):

| Label | Score | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| A | 5 | Very high acquisition likelihood — recent Aus deals, large capital, active |
| B | 4 | High likelihood — active platform, known Aus interest |
| C | 3 | Moderate — possible but no specific recent signals |
| D | 1-2 | Low likelihood — inactive, divesting, or FIRB-constrained |

The Analytics page surfaces:
- **Suggest Upgrade**: Tier 2+ bidders with A/B AI label — worth escalating engagement
- **FIRB Risk**: Bidders where FIRB is flagged in insights — flag for deal team review

## Deployment

Target deployment: Google Cloud Run. `DATABASE_URL` must be set as a runtime environment variable / secret.
